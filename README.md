Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. These are my personal solutions for the puzzles written in Python.

Run the with `python3 __._.py` where the input text file is located in the same directory as the python file. Each solution should print the answer for that corresponding part.
